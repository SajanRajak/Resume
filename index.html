            <li>A Ubiquitous Indoor-Outdoor Detection and Localization Framework for Smartphone Users (First Author)<br>
              Presented in IEMIS 2020 Global Conference and approved for publication in Springler
              <ul>
                <li>Description:There are significant research efforts on indoor positioning technologies
                  as well as GPS based outdoor Navigation system. So there is a requirement for
                  effectively integrating indoor and outdoor localization services and load appropriate
                  system depending on the context</li>
                <li>Contribution: To propose a indoor/outdoor localization framework that can not only
                  detect the context but can also localize at a finer granularity around such transitional
                  areas, such as, the building gates. To implement the framework, data collection app
                  was built for android smartphones. Experiments were also conducted based on data
                  colllected for several use cases in university campus.</li>
                <li>Result: The results indicate that a classification accuracy of 88% could be achieved for
                  indoor-outdoor detection while average localization error is around 1m.</li>
                <li>Technologies Used: Python, Machine Learning, JAVA, Android Developement</li>
                <li>Certification: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c_Skdm8EZrlRL5W3US-Q1h3r-3R0Mpgj/view">View</a>

            <li>Human Activity Recognition using Genetic Algorithm and MIML-KNN(Ongoing Project)
              <ul>
                <li>Description: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is needed for claasification of people
                  who can perfectly execute physical activities and people who can't, so helping us to
                  understand the problem of the latter person's motor skills.</li>
                <li>Contribution: Dataset Collection and preprocessing for implementation in Genetic
                  Algorithm for optimization. Semi-Supervised Learning strategy used for self learning of
                  the system. Conducted different experiments for final result compilation.</li>
                <li>Result: MIML-KNN giving us 95% precision when partially correct predications are also
                  taken into account.</li>
                <li>Technologies Used: MatLab, Python, Machine Learning</li>
